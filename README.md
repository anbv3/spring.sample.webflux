# Spring Boot Webflux Template
#### This is a template to implement a simple api server.
#### To be fully reactive, it needs to be reactive for all levels up to IO and DB. 
#### Also, Spring Webflux is not the fastest server platform.
#### But, still Webflux helps to make a stable and fast server for the micro architector in the production level.
